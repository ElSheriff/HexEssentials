HexEssentials is a Bukkit/Spigot plugin which add essential functions to you server.

I started this project because "Essentials" isn't maintained anymore. I know now there is "EssentialsX" but I wanted to make my own one becuase "EssentialsX" doesn't have the functions I want.


Documentation and Wiki are coming soon (https://wiki.hexlizard.de/)

My apologies for the bad inline documentation, I'm trying to improve this with future versions.


If you want new functions email them to me (ideas@hexlizard.de).
Same goes for bugs (support@hexlizard.de).
